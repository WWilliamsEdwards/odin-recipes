            Steps
        </h1>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Gather all ingredients.</strong> Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8.5- x 4.5-inch loaf pan with cooking spray and line with parchment paper, allowing 2 inches to hang over the long sides. Set aside.</li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>Prepare the bread:</strong> Stir together brown sugar, cinnamon, and salt in a small bowl until fully combined. Set aside. Place a sheet of parchment paper on a work surface. Unfurl 1 of the cans of dough and gently stretch and/or roll into a 10- x 12-inch rectangle. Brush 2 tablespoons of the butter evenly over the entire dough. Sprinkle half (about heaping 1/3 cup) of the cinnamon-sugar mixture to the edges of the dough to cover completely; lightly press and smooth out to adhere (there will be some that falls off).</li>
                <br>
                <li>Cut dough sheet into 12 even rectangles (about 3- x 3 1/2 inches).</li>
                <br>
                <li>Stack dough rectangles on top of each other. Carefully transfer stack to prepared pan with rectangles standing upright (like dominoes). Repeat with remaining can of dough, butter, and cinnamon-sugar mixture.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Transfer loaf pan to the preheated oven and bake until puffed and golden, 40 to 45 minutes, tenting with foil after 30 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool in the pan for 5 minutes. Use parchment as handles to carefully lift loaf out of pan and onto a wire rack to cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes.</li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>While loaf cools, prepare the Glaze:</strong> Beat cream cheese in a medium bowl with an electric hand mixer until whipped. Add powdered sugar, 3 tablespoons of the milk, vanilla, and salt; beat until smooth and creamy, adding more milk, 1 1/2 teaspoons at a time, until desired consistency is reached.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Drizzle desired amount of the glaze over warm or room temperature bread.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Serve with remaining glaze on the side.</li>
            </ol>
